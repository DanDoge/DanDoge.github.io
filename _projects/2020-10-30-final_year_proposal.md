#### Best View Synthesis of 3D models

We proposed a new novel view synthesis(NVS) model that given a single image input, our model can synthesize images of the same object from arbitrary viewpoints. We extend previous NVS methods by disentangling the learned latent space into content and style sub spaces, s.t. our methods can be used to synthesize texture from realworld images. Experiment results show our method outpreforms classical NVS methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.
