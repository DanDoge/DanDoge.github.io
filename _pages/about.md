I am Huang Daoji(黄道吉), a fresh graduate from Peking University, majoring in computer science. My research interest lies in developing data-driven computer vision algorithms that bridge the gap between 2D images and 3D models. I am especially interested in neural 3D representation, texture reconstruction, and related areas.

I will enroll in ETH Zurich's MSCS program in fall 2021. I am actively finding research opportunities in both universities and industry during my gap year. Below are some of my experiments, please refer to [my resume](https://DanDoge.github.io/files/CV_HuangDaoji.pdf) for more details

### Research Projects

- Best View of 3D models(*National Stuent Innovation Program*)
  - assign the best view of 3D models as the most popular view in the Internet by jointly training object detection and pose estimation
- Texture Synthesis of 3D models
  - propose a novel view synthesis network that outperforms classical ones
  - generate 3D models' texture from synthesized images given single view input
- NeRF with reflection
  - incorporate various physical priors into Neural Radiance Field
