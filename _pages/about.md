I am Huang Daoji(黄道吉), a fresh graduate from Peking University, majoring in computer science. My research interest lies in developing data-driven computer vision algorithms that bridge the gap between 2D images and 3D models. I am especially interested in neural 3D representation, texture reconstruction, and related areas. Please see my [past projects](https://DanDoge.github.io/projects/) for more details.

I will enroll in ETH Zurich's MSCS program this fall in 2021. I am actively finding research opportunities in both universities and industry during and after my gap year. Below are some of my past experiences, please refer to [my resume(in pdf)](https://DanDoge.github.io/files/CV_HuangDaoji.pdf) or [a html version](https://DanDoge.github.io/cv/) for more details. I will post my brief notes on some interesting papers from time to time, see [Blog Posts](https://DanDoge.github.io/year-archive/).
