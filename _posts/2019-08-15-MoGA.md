## MoGA: Searching Beyond MobileNetV3

propose a method that focus on GPU latency, reach compatative results to MobileNet.
- tension among: # of params, acc, latency
    - # of params should be resonably large
    - faster on GPU, while remains similar acc.
    - def a reward: acc * (latency / tar) ^ omega
    - latency relationship shown by random network suggest no obvious linear correspondence ==> design network with architecture in mind!
    - suffer from underfitting
- convert reward maxmization to LP
- fast eval of acc and latency
    - eval: FairNAS(supernet?)
    - latency: lookup table
- GPU: fast conv, less (% of) time
