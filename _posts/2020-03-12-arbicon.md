estimate geometric transforms between iamge pairs
- method
    - shared CNN -> feature map for each input
    - 4D coorelation tensor: using cosine similarity
    - then conv(symmetrically) -> aggregate neighbor information, normalize, MLP -> transformation descriptor
    - duplicate, coordconv -> F, done
- loss
    - strong: L2 loss
    - weak: defined on feature map
