deep image prior as a neural renderer
- for cut and paste: albedo should be like origin, shading should be like a shading field, image should be like an image
- trained on paradigms and works on real image data: pretrained and fixed
- image harmonizaiton as baseline
- normal from previous methods -> shading consistency test
