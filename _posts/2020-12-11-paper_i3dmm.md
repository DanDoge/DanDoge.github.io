deep implicit 3D morphable model
- disentabgle geometry and color components
  - geometry: identity, expressions and hairstyle
  - color: identity and hairstyle
- SDF for surface representations
- data preprocessing: landmark annotation, head cropping
- mesh sampling for SDF training
  - additional points for eyes noses and mouth
- deform a reference shape
  - x ---deformation network---> x in reference shape coordnate
  - enforce landmark color to be precise
  - L2 prior on latent codes
