differentiable alignment and rendering
- RGBD images -> feature point cloud -> correspondence -> alignment -> rendering
  - feature: coord, color, feature
  - correspondence from cosine distance in features
  - ratio test to drop some estimations
  - alignment by Kabsch's algorithm
  - randomized optimizations by random start point
- forcing feature alignment: render this view by another view's feature point cloud
