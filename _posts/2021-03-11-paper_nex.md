tons of small boxes around the surface
- kind of like mesh, but build a small nerf for each vertex: combination of volumetric and primitie-based approaches
  - volumetric primitive: center, rotation, scale, and a dense voxel grid
- decoder: latent code -- conv --> set of primitives
- windowing function: a weight of distance from the primitive origin: moving the primitive instead of learning the payload
