## NO Need to Worry about Adversarial Examples in Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles

perturbation of input may cause network to misclassify objects
- while not perceptible to human eyes
- generalize over diff. network architectures
- are they still adversarial in real world?(e.g. as an image)
    - yes...but in a short distance and fixed view
    - no...for most of the time

results
- distance: yes
- angle: yes...but not tested
