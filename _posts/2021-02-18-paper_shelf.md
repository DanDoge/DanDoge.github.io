supervised by off-the-shelf recongnition systems
- synthesized novel views are indistunguishible from image collections
- volumetric rendering from explicit grid
  - enforcing a symmetry: also serve as a constraint on pose estimation
- consistency loss
- instance-level refinement
  - mesh-image: iteration
