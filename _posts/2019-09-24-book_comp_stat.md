## Notes for Computational Statistics

### introduction

one of the textbook for statistical computing

Bessel's inequality
- just expand the square


transform of the CDF
- characteristic function: need to know more later
- moment generating function: Taylor, easy.

### Monte Carlo Methods for Statistical Inference

task: estimate a quantity related to a dist.
- theta = intergrate f(x) over some region
- decomposit to intergrate g(x)p(x) ==> theta = E_p[g(x)]
- rarely the best in low dimensional cases
