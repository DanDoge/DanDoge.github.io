images -> coarse geometry -> depth map -> target image
- COLMAP for coarse geometry
- depth map from MVS method
- select K images that maximize the overlap with targe view (overlap from depth map)
  - encode -> warp -> fusion
- wear a mask
  - for pixels with infinite depth
- note the performance gap among fvs and nerf++: different people reaches different results
