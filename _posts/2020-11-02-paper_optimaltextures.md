texture synthesis through optimal transport
- a pdf that operates on textures directly
  - s.t. output is statictically indistinguishable from input
- histogram matching
  - on a random N dimentional orthogonal basis, and project pdf to this basis
  - minimizing difference in projections
- image-paramid synthesis
- luminance-only transfer on geryscale
  - RGB to HSI color space
