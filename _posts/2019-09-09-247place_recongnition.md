## 24/7 place recognition by view synthesis

synthesis novel view of street view for place recognition
- render virtual view and depth map
- VLAD encoding of local image descriptors
- reduced invarience from lack of keypoint annotation...but it is an advantage for recognition

well...quite brute force method
- grid on street map
- generate novel view from panorama and depth map
